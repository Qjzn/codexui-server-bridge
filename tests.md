3. Select `New worktree`, then select `Local project` and compare active/inactive contrast.
4. Tab to the toggle options with keyboard navigation and verify the focus ring is visible.
5. Confirm icon color remains readable for selected and unselected options.

#### Expected Results
- Toggle container, options, and text/icons use dark-friendly colors.
- Hover and selected states are clearly distinguishable in dark mode.
- Keyboard focus ring is visible and does not blend into the background.

#### Rollback/Cleanup
- Return appearance and runtime selection to the previous user preference.

### Feature: pnpm dev script installs dependencies and starts Vite

#### Prerequisites
- `pnpm` is installed globally (`npm i -g pnpm` or via corepack).
- Repository is cloned and `node_modules/` does not exist (or may be stale).

#### Steps
1. Remove `node_modules/` if present: `rm -rf node_modules`.
2. Run `pnpm run dev`.
3. Wait for Vite dev server to start and display the local URL.
4. Open the displayed URL in a browser.

#### Steps
1. Send a prompt that keeps the assistant generating for several seconds.
2. Immediately click the `Stop` button before the first assistant chunk fully completes.
3. Confirm generation halts.
4. Repeat with a resumed/existing in-progress thread (reload app while a turn is running, then click `Stop`).

#### Expected Results
- No error appears saying `turn/interrupt requires turnId`.
- Turn is interrupted successfully in both immediate-stop and resumed-thread scenarios.
- Thread state exits in-progress and the stop control returns to idle.

#### Rollback/Cleanup
- None.

### Feature: Revert PR #16 mobile viewport and chat scroll behavior changes

#### Prerequisites
- App is running from this repository.
- A thread exists with enough messages to scroll.
- Test on a mobile-sized viewport (for example 375x812).

#### Steps
1. Open an existing thread and scroll up to the middle of the chat history.
2. Wait for an assistant response to stream while staying at the same scroll position.
3. Send a follow-up message and observe chat positioning when completion finishes.
4. Open the composer on mobile and drag within the composer area.
5. Open/close the on-screen keyboard on mobile and verify the page layout remains usable.

#### Expected Results
- Chat behavior matches pre-PR #16 baseline (no PR #16 scroll-preservation logic active).
- No regressions from reverting PR #16 changes in conversation rendering and composer behavior.
- Mobile layout no longer includes PR #16 visual-viewport sync changes.

#### Rollback/Cleanup
- Re-apply PR #16 commits if the reverted behavior is not desired.

### Feature: Thread load capped to latest 10 turns

#### Prerequisites
- App is running from this repository.
- At least one thread exists with more than 10 turns/messages.

#### Steps
1. Open a long thread that previously caused UI lag during initial load.
2. While the thread is loading, immediately click another thread in the sidebar.
3. Return to the long thread.
4. Count visible loaded history blocks and confirm only the newest portion is shown.
5. Call `/codex-api/rpc` with method `thread/read` for the same thread and inspect `result.thread.turns.length`.
6. Call `/codex-api/rpc` with method `thread/resume` for the same thread and inspect `result.thread.turns.length`.

#### Expected Results
- Initial thread load renders only the most recent 10 turns.
- UI remains responsive during thread load.
- You can switch to another thread without the UI freezing.
- `thread/read` and `thread/resume` RPC responses contain at most 10 turns.

#### Rollback/Cleanup
- No cleanup required.

### Feature: Empty thread first message materializes the thread route

#### Prerequisites
- App is running from this repository.
- Browser DevTools Console is available.
- A valid workspace path is available for `thread/start` (for example this repository root).

#### Steps
1. In the browser DevTools Console, run:
   ```js
   const created = await fetch('/codex-api/rpc', {
     method: 'POST',
     headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' },
     body: JSON.stringify({
       method: 'thread/start',
       params: { cwd: 'C:/Users/SW/Documents/Playground/codexui' },
     }),
   }).then((res) => res.json());
   window.__emptyThreadId = created.result?.thread?.id || '';
   window.__emptyThreadId;
   ```
2. Open `#/thread/<emptyThreadId>` with the returned id.
3. Confirm the page renders the empty-thread state: title/status show `空会话`, subtitle explains the thread has no messages yet, and the body shows `当前会话还没有消息。`
4. In the same empty thread, type a unique first prompt in the composer and submit it.
5. Confirm the UI stays on the same thread route instead of jumping back to `#/home`, and the empty-thread copy disappears.
6. Wait for the first turn to start rendering or for the in-progress state to appear.
7. Call `/codex-api/rpc` with method `thread/read` for the same thread id and inspect `result.thread.turns`.

#### Expected Results
- `thread/start` returns a thread id even before the first user message is sent.
- The empty-thread route is usable: composer accepts input and send works from that route directly.
- Submitting the first message materializes the thread without a permanent `is not materialized yet`, `before first user message`, or `rollout is empty` error surfacing to the user.
- The route remains on the same thread id and conversation content replaces the empty-thread state.
- `thread/read` returns at least one turn for the thread after the first message is sent.

#### Rollback/Cleanup
- Archive the temporary test thread from the UI, or call `/codex-api/rpc` with method `thread/archive` for the created thread id.

### Feature: Skills list request scoped to active thread cwd

#### Prerequisites
- App is running from this repository.
- Browser DevTools Network tab is open.
- At least two threads exist with different `cwd` values.

#### Steps
1. Reload the app and wait for initial data load.
2. In Network tab, inspect `/codex-api/rpc` requests with method `skills/list`.
3. Verify request params contain `cwds` with only the currently selected thread cwd.
4. Switch to another thread with a different cwd.
5. Inspect the next `skills/list` request and verify `cwds` now contains only the new selected thread cwd.

#### Expected Results
- `skills/list` no longer sends every thread cwd in one request.
- Each `skills/list` call includes at most one cwd for the active thread context.
- Skills list still updates when changing selected thread.

#### Rollback/Cleanup
- No cleanup required.

### Feature: GitHub Website Redesign — OpenClaw-Inspired Design + Web Demo Link

#### Prerequisites
- The `docs/index.html` file has been updated with the new design.
- A browser is available to view the page locally or via GitHub Pages.

#### Steps
1. Open `docs/index.html` in a browser (local file or via GitHub Pages).
2. Verify the fixed **navigation bar** at top with brand logo, section links, and "Get the App" CTA.
3. Verify the **announcement banner** below nav shows the XCodex WASM link.
4. Verify **hero section** displays lobster emoji, "AnyClaw" title with gradient, tagline, and four CTA buttons: "Try Web Demo", "Google Play", "Download APK", "GitHub".
5. Click **"Try Web Demo"** button — confirm it navigates to `https://xcodex.slrv.md/#/`.
6. Verify the **stats bar** shows key metrics (2 AI Agents, 1 APK, 0 Root Required, 73MB, infinity).
7. Scroll to **Live Demo** section — verify embedded iframe loads `https://xcodex.slrv.md/#/` with mock browser chrome.
8. Scroll to **Screenshots** section — verify four images render (2 desktop, 2 mobile).
9. Scroll to **Features** section — verify 6 feature cards in a 3-column grid.
10. Scroll to **Testimonials** section — verify two rows of auto-scrolling marquee cards (row 2 scrolls reverse). Hover to pause.
11. Scroll through **Architecture**, **Boot Sequence**, **Quick Start**, and **Tech Stack** sections — verify content renders.
12. Verify the **footer** includes a "Web Demo" link to `https://xcodex.slrv.md/#/`.
13. Test responsive at 768px and 480px — nav links collapse, grids single-column, buttons stack vertically.

#### Expected Results
- Page has a dark, premium feel with gradient accents, grain overlay, and smooth animations.
- All links to `https://xcodex.slrv.md/#/` work (announcement, hero CTA, demo section, quick start text, footer).
- Marquee testimonials scroll continuously and pause on hover.
- Embedded iframe demo loads successfully.
- Mobile responsive layout works at all breakpoints.

#### Rollback/Cleanup
- Revert `docs/index.html` to previous commit if needed.

### Feature: 会话切换轻量加载态与执行中输入区下拉可用

#### Prerequisites
- `7420` 服务正在运行，且前端资源已更新到本轮构建版本。
- 至少存在两个有消息历史的会话，方便来回切换观察。
- 当前线程可以进入执行中状态，或可手动触发一次长任务。

#### Steps
1. 打开 `7420` 页面并进入任意已有消息的会话。
2. 在左侧连续切换到另一个有历史消息的会话。
3. 观察切换过程中的会话区加载反馈。
4. 确认不会同时出现大骨架、切换遮罩和顶部同步条等多套加载动画。
5. 确认仅保留一个轻量顶部状态提示，旧内容会轻微淡出，而不是整块突然清空跳变。
6. 让当前线程进入执行中状态。
7. 在执行中点击输入框下方的 `模型`、`技能`、`思考强度` 三个控件。
8. 分别确认三个控件都可以正常打开并选择，不会因为执行中而被禁用。

#### Expected Results
- 会话切换时只出现一套低感知加载提示，不再叠加多个加载动画。
- 会话内容切换过程更平滑，旧内容短暂保留并淡出，新内容加载完成后自然替换。
- 执行任务过程中，`模型`、`技能`、`思考强度` 三个按钮仍可点击和打开。
- 修改这些控件不会打断当前正在执行的 turn，只影响后续发送或排队消息。

#### Rollback/Cleanup
- 无需额外清理；若需回退，恢复本轮前端构建前的 `ThreadComposer.vue`、`ThreadConversation.vue` 与 `App.vue` 版本。

- 同时准备桌面端和手机端各做一轮滚动体验验证。

#### Steps
1. 打开长会话，连续上下快速滚动消息列表。
2. 观察滚动过程中是否出现明显掉帧、白块、延迟跟手或 hover 控件抖动。
3. 在会话中切换到另一条有历史消息的线程，观察切换时顶部加载提示和内容过渡。
4. 打开侧栏，再关闭侧栏，检查遮罩、抽屉和主内容切换是否仍然平滑。
5. 在消息列表底部观察“回到底部”按钮、消息卡片、队列区、标题栏和输入区的视觉层级是否更轻。

#### Expected Results
- 长会话滚动时，页面跟手更稳定，不应再出现明显连续掉帧。
- 会话切换仅保留低感知过渡，不出现滤镜感或重阴影拖影。
- 标题栏、消息卡片、队列区和输入区整体更平、更轻，视觉层级更统一。
- 侧栏抽屉与主内容的切换应顺滑，不应因遮罩或重模糊造成明显性能负担。

#### Rollback/Cleanup
- 若需回退，恢复本轮前的 `ThreadConversation.vue`、`DesktopLayout.vue`、`ContentHeader.vue`、`ThreadComposer.vue`、`QueuedMessages.vue` 与 `App.vue` 版本。

#### Prerequisites
- `7420` 服务运行中，前端资源已更新到本轮构建版本。
- Android CX-Codex 或移动端 WebView 可以访问当前服务。
- 准备一个可运行长任务的会话，用于观察锁屏/切后台恢复。

#### Steps
1. 在 Android 端打开一个会话并发送一条会执行较久的任务。
2. 等待界面出现执行中状态后，锁屏 10-20 秒。
3. 解锁回到 CX-Codex。
4. 观察页面是否先恢复“执行中/等待确认/已完成”等状态，而不是长时间卡在空白或旧状态。
5. 如果任务已完成，等待 2-3 秒，确认最终消息会自动补齐。
6. 再次切后台 10 秒后回到应用，重复观察一次。
7. 在桌面浏览器打开同一会话，确认 Web 端状态仍能正常跟随，不受 Android 恢复策略影响。

#### Expected Results
- Android 恢复后第一轮同步先走 runtime snapshot 和事件回放，不应立即触发明显卡顿的全量刷新。
- 任务执行中应显示执行态；任务完成后不应长期停留在“思考中”。
- 若有授权请求，应显示等待确认状态，并保留停止/发送队列逻辑。
- 第二轮补偿同步会按需刷新消息和线程列表，最终内容应自动补齐。
- `/codex-api/health` 中近期 `recentTimeouts` 不应因为恢复动作快速增加。

#### Rollback/Cleanup
- 无需清理。若需回退，恢复本轮 `src/composables/useDesktopState.ts`、`src/api/codexGateway.ts`、`src/App.vue` 和 `src/server/codexAppServerBridge.ts` 的改动。

2. 确认本机 `/health`、`/codex-api/health`、事件回放、公网 `/health` 均通过。
3. 确认桌面 `1440x900`、手机 `390x844`、折叠屏 `884x1104` 三个视口均无横向溢出和页面错误。
4. 执行 `npm run mobile:android:sync`。
5. 执行 `.\gradlew.bat assembleRelease`。
6. 检查 release APK 的 `versionName` 为当前 `package.json` 版本，`versionCode` 按 `major * 10000 + minor * 100 + patch` 递增。
7. 推送数字 tag 触发 GitHub Release 时，确认 `.github/workflows/release.yml` 未覆盖 `APP_VERSION_CODE`，Actions 构建也应使用同一套版本码规则。

#### Expected Results
- 自动化回归全部通过。
- Android Web 资源同步成功。
- release APK 构建成功。
- 本地和 GitHub Actions 产出的数字版本都对应 `major * 10000 + minor * 100 + patch` 版本码，可覆盖安装上一版构建。

### Feature: 后台同步减少重型线程列表轮询

#### Prerequisites
- `7420` 服务运行中。
- 至少有一个已加载会话。
- 浏览器或 Android 壳能够连接通知流。

#### Steps
1. 打开任意会话并保持页面可见 2 分钟；可同时打开多个页面模拟旧客户端或多端访问。
2. 观察 `/codex-api/health` 的 `rpcDiagnostics.recentSlowRpc`。
3. 在会话执行中，确认前端仍能显示运行态、停止按钮和当前会话增量内容。
4. 锁屏或切后台后回到 Android 壳，确认 resume 首次恢复不会强制拉完整线程列表。
5. 手动点击刷新，确认仍会刷新线程列表和当前会话内容。
6. 观察任务完成、状态变化、通知流重连时，确认它们不会单独触发完整 `thread/list`，只有新建/归档/重命名等列表结构变化才触发。

#### Expected Results
- 后台心跳不再因为通知流陈旧或会话执行中而固定触发 `thread/list`。
- Android resume 主要走事件回放、runtime snapshot 和当前会话消息同步。
- 手动刷新、首次加载、通知明确指示列表变化时，线程列表仍会更新。
- RPC 队列中不应再持续出现每 30 秒左右一次的慢 `thread/list`。
- `turn/completed`、`thread/status/changed` 等运行态通知只刷新当前会话，不刷新完整列表。
- 多页面或旧客户端短时间重复请求相同 `thread/list` 时，后端应返回短缓存；新建/归档/重命名等结构变化会让缓存失效。

#### Rollback/Cleanup
- 若需回退，恢复 `src/composables/useDesktopState.ts` 中后台同步间隔和线程列表刷新判断。

---

### Feature: 7420 稳定性浸泡测试脚本

#### Prerequisites

#### Steps
1. 短时验证脚本：执行 `npm run test:7420:soak -- -DurationSeconds 90 -IntervalSeconds 15`。
2. 发布前浸泡：执行 `npm run test:7420:soak -- -DurationSeconds 7200 -IntervalSeconds 15`。
3. 如只验证本机稳定性，可追加 `-SkipPublic`。
4. 查看 `output\soak-7420\soak-*.json` 报告。

#### Expected Results
- 脚本在每个采样点输出本机、公网、API、pending/queued RPC、timeout 和慢 `thread/list` 信息。
- 没有连续健康检查失败。
- `queuedRpcCount` 与 `pendingRpcCount` 不超过阈值。
- 浸泡窗口内不出现新的 RPC timeout。
- 脚本退出码为 `0`，JSON 报告 `summary.passed=true`。

#### Rollback/Cleanup

5. 查看 `/codex-api/health` 的 `queuedRpcCount`、`pendingRpcCount` 和 `recentTimeouts`。
6. 新建、归档或重命名会话，确认结构变化仍会清理列表缓存并刷新列表。

#### Expected Results
- 新鲜期内重复 `thread/list` 不进入 app-server RPC 队列。
- 缓存过期但仍在兜底窗口内时，前端不等待慢列表 RPC 才恢复页面。
- 后台刷新同一缓存键时只保留一轮 in-flight 请求。
- 结构变化后缓存失效，列表最终反映新建、归档或重命名结果。
- `recentTimeouts` 不应因为列表刷新增加。

#### Rollback/Cleanup
- 若需回退，恢复 `src/server/codexAppServerBridge.ts` 中 `thread/list` 缓存读取和刷新逻辑。

### Feature: 会话切换主内容优先加载

#### Prerequisites
- `7420` 服务运行中，当前构建已包含 `2.1.5` 切换链路优化。
- 至少准备两个已有消息会话，其中一个会话上下文进度尚未缓存或 token 统计可能需要从 session log 补齐。

#### Steps
1. 打开 Web 或 Android 端会话列表。
2. 从会话 A 切换到会话 B。
3. 观察主内容区消息是否优先出现。
4. 打开 `/codex-api/health`，观察切换时 `recentSlowRpc` 中是否还先出现无必要的 `thread/resume`。
5. 观察上下文进度条：未就绪时可显示占位，稍后后台补齐。
6. 直接通过 URL 打开一个会话路由，确认不会先等待完整 runtime snapshot 校验再进入页面。
7. 连续快速切换两个会话，观察 Network 中同一会话是否只保留一条主 `/codex-api/state/thread/:id` 读取。
8. 等待一次后台 `thread/list` 慢刷新，再切换会话，确认主内容读取不会长期排在列表刷新后面。

#### Expected Results
- 正常已有会话切换不应先发 `thread/resume`，主 `thread/read` 优先执行。
- 上下文 token 统计不阻塞消息首屏显示。
- 同一会话不会因为后台同步和点击选择同时触发重复主内容读取。
- 慢 `thread/list` 只能后台更新列表，不应阻塞当前会话主内容首屏。
- 如果会话确实未物化，才允许执行 `thread/resume` 后重试读取。
- 路由进入会话时先选择会话并加载主内容，失败再由内容加载链路呈现错误。

#### Rollback/Cleanup
- 若需回退，恢复 `src/composables/useDesktopState.ts`、`src/server/codexAppServerBridge.ts`、`src/api/codexGateway.ts` 与 `src/App.vue`。

8. 再次切换应用后返回，确认不会重新出现旧的运行卡片。
9. 如果旧版本状态下仍显示停止按钮，点击停止，确认前端会刷新并清理已结束任务的残留运行态。
10. 在任务完成回复已经显示后，如果底部仍残留旧命令卡片，等待一次自动刷新或手动点刷新，确认旧命令卡片会消失。
11. 在会话顶部点击刷新按钮，确认按钮等待真实刷新完成后才恢复可点，且刷新后不再显示残留 `思考中`。

#### Expected Results
- Android 回到前台后会立即强制刷新当前会话消息。
- 如果 runtime snapshot 已过期且 fresh 消息中已有后续助手回复，旧的 `inProgress` 命令不会继续作为强运行信号。
- 已完成任务不会卡在 `思考中`、`执行命令` 或显示虚假的已运行时长。
- 停止已结束任务时不会继续保留无效的 `思考中` 卡片或错误停止状态。
- 即使 App 后台期间漏掉 `turn/completed` 通知，残留 live 命令也不会追加在完成回复后继续显示。
- 会话顶部刷新按钮执行强恢复刷新：中断旧同步、重拉 runtime snapshot/消息/pending requests/thread list，并收敛本地残留运行态。
- 真正仍在运行、仍有 fresh runtime/通知/权限请求/队列信号的任务仍保持运行态。

5. 等待回复完成后查看输入区模式。
6. 打开 `/codex-api/health`，确认 `activePlanModeTurnCount` 回到 `0`。
7. 再输入 `开始执行`，确认默认已处于 `执行`，不会继续被计划模式拦截。

#### Expected Results
- 前端发送计划时使用原生 `mode: plan`，不再把整段 Plan Mode 规则注入用户消息。
- 如果后端不支持原生 `mode: plan`，才降级注入只读计划提示。
- 计划消息发送后输入区自动切回 `执行`。
- 计划完成后不残留停止按钮、思考中状态或 `activePlanModeTurnCount`。

3. 等待任务完成，确认最终回复出现后思考/命令卡片自动消失。
4. 再发送一个任务，任务执行期间切换应用或锁屏 2 分钟后返回。
5. 等待自动同步完成，确认没有旧的 `思考中` 残留。
6. 搜索历史线程标题，确认搜索不会造成大量 `thread/read` 慢调用。
7. 打开 `/codex-api/health`，确认没有因为普通 `thread/read` 留下 `queued` 执行态。

#### Expected Results
- 普通 `thread/read` 不会被记录成执行队列状态。
- 过期运行态在没有 fresh `thread/read` 佐证时降级为 `sync_degraded`，不会继续展示为思考中。
- 搜索索引只用 `session_index.jsonl` 的标题补齐历史记录，不逐个读取历史线程。
- 计划模式完成、失败或中断后，`/codex-api/health` 中 `activePlanModeTurnCount` 回到 `0`。
- 安卓前台恢复会按通知 replay、runtime snapshot、消息详情的顺序强制收敛当前会话。
- 会话顶部刷新可清理已结束任务留下的旧 `liveOverlay`、`activeTurnId`、运行中命令卡片和停止按钮。
- 新启动日志不再输出明文 `Password:` 值，敏感 token/query 参数会被脱敏。

7. 如果后端 `turn/interrupt` 发生 timeout，刷新当前会话再观察。

#### Expected Results
- 点击停止后前端立即隐藏 `思考中` 卡片和停止按钮，不等待 `turn/interrupt` RPC 返回。
- 本地 `activeTurnId`、`liveOverlay`、运行中命令残影和 pending turn request 会同步清理。
- 如果 `turn/interrupt` 超时或 app-server 已无 active turn，后端 runtime snapshot 会收敛为 `interrupted`，不会继续返回 `stopping`。
- 刷新当前会话后不会重新出现旧的 `思考中` 卡片。

#### Rollback/Cleanup
- 若需回退，恢复 `src/composables/useDesktopState.ts` 的 `settleInterruptedThreadState` 调用，以及 `src/server/codexAppServerBridge.ts` 中 interrupt timeout 的本地收敛逻辑。

---

### Feature: 完成快照清理本地 pending turn

#### Prerequisites
- `7420` 服务运行中，当前构建已包含 runtime snapshot 收敛修复。
- 已存在一个后端快照显示 `executionState=completed`、`inProgress=false` 的会话。

#### Steps
1. 打开一个此前出现过 `思考中` 残留的会话。

- 停止按钮不会在已完成会话里残留。

#### Regression Evidence
- 2026-05-13 验证线程 `019e15aa-f206-7e01-8258-9361cc4768ce`：
  - `/codex-api/runtime/snapshot` 返回 `executionState=completed`、`inProgress=false`、`canStop=false`。
  - 浏览器回归断言 `hasThinking=false`、`hasStop=false`。

#### Rollback/Cleanup
- 若需回退，恢复 `src/composables/useDesktopState.ts` 中 `applyRuntimeSnapshotState` 对 settled 快照清理 `pendingTurnRequest` 的逻辑。

---

### Feature: 完成快照强制补齐最新消息

#### Prerequisites
- `7420` 服务运行中，当前构建已包含 settled runtime message refresh 修复。
- 存在一个老线程：`thread/read(includeTurns:false)` 的 `updatedAt` 不随最新 turn 变化，但 `thread/read(includeTurns:true)` 已能读到最终回复。

#### Steps
1. 在当前线程发送任务。
2. 任务执行期间关闭页面、切换应用或让通知流断开。
3. 等待后端任务完成。
4. 重新打开同一线程。
5. 等待一次后台同步或点击顶部刷新。
6. 观察页面尾部消息和底部 live overlay。

#### Expected Results
- `/codex-api/runtime/snapshot` 返回 `completed`、`interrupted`、`failed`、`idle` 或 `sync_degraded` 时，前端把它视为非运行态。
- 即使线程列表版本号没有变化，前端也会按 runtime 的完成事件 key 对当前线程强制重拉一次消息详情。
- 服务端不能仅因 `thread/read(includeTurns:false)` 的 `updatedAt` 与缓存一致就复用旧 turns；当 runtime 已完成且缓存早于完成事件时，必须重读完整 turns。
- 前端遇到 settled runtime 的补齐场景时，会额外走一次直接 `thread/read(includeTurns:true)`，避免旧状态快照缓存遮住最终回复。
- 若后续轮询返回的状态快照比本地已补齐的消息更旧，前端会保留本地较新的消息，不允许旧快照倒退覆盖。
- 最新用户消息和最终回复会补齐显示。
- 旧的 `思考中` 卡片、停止按钮和运行中命令残影不会继续出现。

#### Regression Evidence
- 2026-05-13 浏览器自动化验证线程 `019e15aa-f206-7e01-8258-9361cc4768ce`：
  - 页面命中最新问题 `为什么生产环境的回复比测试环境慢`。
  - 页面命中最终回复关键词 `生产比测试慢` / `生产链路更长`。
  - 等待 7 秒后仍为 `hasThinking=false`、`hasNoCommand=false`，旧状态快照未再覆盖新消息。

#### Rollback/Cleanup
- 若需回退，恢复 `src/composables/useDesktopState.ts` 中 `settledRuntimeMessageRefreshKeyByThreadId` 和 `sync_degraded` settled 判定相关改动。

---

5. 调用 `/codex-api/runtime/events?afterSeq=0&limit=20`，确认事件带递增 `seq`。
6. 关闭页面后等待任务完成，再重新打开同一线程。
7. 点击顶部刷新，确认会调用 reconcile 并按后端状态收敛。

#### Expected Results
- `runtimeStore.path` 指向 `~/.cx-codex/runtime.sqlite`。
- `runtimeStore.latestSeq` 随 app-server notification 增长。
- 发送请求先产生 runtime request，再进入 `running` 或 `start_uncertain`。
- `start_uncertain` 不会无限显示普通 `思考中`，而是显示 `确认任务状态中`。
- 页面恢复优先读取 runtime snapshot，再按需补消息。
- SQLite 事件 replay 不依赖内存 buffer，页面关闭后仍可补游标。

### Feature: 本地文档预览

#### Prerequisites
- 当前构建已包含 `local-preview.html`。
- 本地文件通过 `/codex-local-browse/*path` 或 `/local-preview.html?path=<absolutePath>` 打开。

#### Steps
1. 打开 Markdown 文件。
2. 打开 DOCX 文件。
3. 打开图片文件。
4. 打开 PDF 文件。
5. 从 `/codex-local-browse/*path` 打开一个可预览文件。

#### Expected Results
- Markdown 在本地页面渲染为 HTML，并清洗原始 HTML。
- DOCX 在浏览器内预览；复杂排版可继续使用系统打开或下载。
- PDF 使用本地 `pdf.js` worker 渲染，支持放大和缩小。
- 图片在预览页内展示。
- `/codex-local-browse/*path` 对可预览文件跳转到 `local-preview.html`。
- 文档内容不上传到第三方在线预览服务。

#### Regression Evidence
- 2026-05-28 静态验证：`git diff --check` 通过。
- 2026-05-28 构建验证：`npm.cmd run build` 通过。
- 2026-05-28 浏览器自动化验证：
  - `README.md` 显示 `预览已就绪`，页面存在 `.markdown-body`。
  - DOCX 示例文件显示 `Word 预览已就绪`，页面存在 `.docx-body .docx`。
  - `cx-codex-logo.png` 显示 `预览已就绪`，页面存在 `.image-body img`。
  - 临时 PDF 显示 `PDF 预览已就绪，共 1 页`，页面存在 `.pdf-page canvas`。
  - `/codex-local-browse/.../README.md` 自动跳转到 `/local-preview.html?path=...`。
- 2026-05-28 7420 实机前端回归：
  - 重启后 `/health` 正常，`/codex-api/health` 显示 `pendingRpcCount=0`、`queuedRpcCount=0`、`pendingServerRequestCount=0`、`activePlanModeTurnCount=0`。
  - 首页 `/#/` 加载出侧栏和输入框。
  - `/skills` 规范化为 `/#/skills`，技能中心无白屏。
  - `/github-trending` 规范化为 `/#/github-trending`，GitHub 热门无白屏。
  - `/codex-local-file?inline=1` 返回 `Content-Disposition: inline`，`download=1` 返回 `attachment`。
  - 393x852 移动视口下 DOCX 预览无横向溢出，`scrollWidth == clientWidth`，操作按钮未越界。
- 2026-05-28 Android 兼容回归：
  - `git diff --check` 通过。
  - `npm.cmd run build` 通过。
  - `android\gradlew.bat assembleDebug` 通过。
  - 使用临时 17422 服务和 393x852 视口验证：模拟 Android 原生 `downloadFileFromUrl` 不返回时，12 秒后状态从 `正在请求系统下载...` 收敛为兼容下载提示，打开/下载按钮恢复可点，页面无横向溢出；再次点击下载会直接走兼容下载，不再重复等待原生回调。
  - 模拟 Android 原生 `openFileFromUrl` 返回 `started` 时，页面显示 `已开始后台打开，完成后会自动唤起系统应用。`。
  - 点击 `返回会话` 后 URL 回到 `/#/`，避免文件预览页返回后停在不可操作的全屏列表状态。
- 2026-05-28 公开地址 PDF 回归：
  - URL：`http://116.62.234.104:17420/local-preview.html?path=E%3A%2Fjavaword%2FCXCodex%2Ffinal_multi_target_resume%2F%E9%82%B5%E5%8D%AB-%E6%9C%80%E7%BB%88%E6%8A%95%E9%80%92%E7%AE%80%E5%8E%86-%E4%BA%A7%E5%93%81%E7%BB%8F%E7%90%86%E8%A7%A3%E5%86%B3%E6%96%B9%E6%A1%88%E9%A1%B9%E7%9B%AE%E7%BB%8F%E7%90%86-2026-05-27.pdf`。
  - 登录后 393x852 移动视口显示 `PDF 预览已就绪，共 2 页。`，页面 `scrollWidth == clientWidth`。
  - `复制路径` 在公开 HTTP 页面可用，状态显示 `路径已复制。`，干净会话 `errors=[]`。
  - 模拟 Android 原生 `downloadFileFromUrl` 不返回时，12 秒后不再卡在 `正在请求系统下载...`，按钮恢复，状态显示兼容下载提示；再次点击下载直接进入兼容下载。
- 2026-05-31 Android 下载稳定性回归：
  - `git diff --check` 通过。
  - `npm.cmd run build` 通过。
  - 浏览器自动化打开本地 `local-preview.html?path=README.md`，注入 Android 环境和不会返回的 `downloadFileFromUrl` 后点击 `下载`，页面直接显示 `已请求系统下载...`，`nativeDownloadCalled=false`，不再出现 `原生下载未确认`。
  - 393x852 移动视口下 `scrollWidth <= clientWidth`，下载状态和按钮不造成横向溢出。
  - 构建产物 `dist-cli/index.js` 已包含 `/codex-local-browse/*path` 文件操作页的 Android 分支：点击 `下载` 先触发浏览器/WebView 下载，不再等待原生下载 Promise。
